# Lab 02 - Tools and Context

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/justeban/02-tools-and-context.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/justeban/02-tools-and-context)

## Overview
This a module that focuses on making methods that match the built array methods that we are so used to from scratch. 

This list module includes array methods such as ```push()```, ```pop()```, ```shift()```, ```unshift()```, ```forEach()```, ```map()```, ```filter()```, ```reduce()```, ```slice()```, and ```splice()```.

In this module, I utilize Test Driven Development to make sure our module operated as expected and I integrated with Travis to verify successful builds as I deploy to GitHub.
